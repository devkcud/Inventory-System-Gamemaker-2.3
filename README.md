# About
It is a simple inventory for your game. You can download the project and modify the code if you want.
If you have errors about your code, you can talk to me on Discord otap#2130, and I will try to help you. Just remember, google is your friend.

# Code
I made it in 23 hours, for a Game Jam, if you want to help me improve the code, you can do this by talking to me on Discord or just modifying the code yourself.
